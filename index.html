                <div class="twelve columns">
                    <p>My name is Pieter Joost van de Sande, an accomplished independent software architect specializing in message-based systems. With a proven track record, I have garnered extensive experience in this field. I am privileged to have the opportunity to share my knowledge on prominent stages at international conferences such as Microsoft TechDays, SDC, and NDC.</p>

                    <p>During my leisure time, I actively contribute to open source projects, which you can explore on my <a href="https://github.com/pjvds?tab=overview&from=2015-12-01">Github profile</a>. What sets me apart is my willingness to delve into diverse programming languages and paradigms, allowing me to gain valuable insights from their unique attributes. While I consider C# to be an exceptional general-purpose language, I am equally impressed by the thriving ecosystem of the JVM and the elegance and simplicity exemplified by Go. Generally, I tend to gravitate towards statically typed languages; however, when it comes to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Agile methodologies, dynamic languages have their merits.</p>

                    <p>I firmly believe in adopting modern software development practices to enhance productivity and maintain high-quality code. I am well-versed in utilizing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure efficient and error-free software delivery. Furthermore, I embrace the principles of DevOps, seamlessly integrating development and operations to foster collaboration and streamline the release process.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I am a strong advocate for clean code and employ well-established design patterns to create scalable and maintainable solutions. With a keen interest in the principles of SOLID, CQRS, Event Sourcing, DDD, I strive to write code that is robust, flexible, and easily extensible.</p>

                    <p>My contributions and engagement within the software development community have been recognized by Microsoft, and I am honored to have been awarded the prestigious <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/default.aspx">Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award</a>.</p>

                    <p>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything I can assist you with!</p>

                            <p>In the realm of evolving software systems, incorporating data schema changes can pose significant challenges. These changes are far from trivial, especially in running systems that must maintain continuous availability. Introducing event sourcing as an architectural approach adds an additional layer of complexity to this dynamic. I had the privilege of participating in a study that ultimately led to the creation of "The Dark Side of Event Sourcing" paper. As an expert with extensive experience in event sourcing, my insights and expertise were instrumental in shaping the understanding of the intricacies and potential pitfalls associated with this approach. This involvement allowed me to contribute valuable insights to the broader software development community, fostering a deeper understanding of the practical implications and considerations of implementing event sourcing in real-world scenarios.</p>

                        <p>DoubleDutch is an award-winning provider of mobile event applications, with a unique focus on capturing and surfacing data from live events. The first to bring a data-driven technology approach to the event industry, DoubleDutch believes in the power of digitizing live engagement to supercharge business outcomes. The DoubleDutch Live Engagement Platform powers events, conferences, and trade shows for more than 1,700 customers including Forbes, Humana, LinkedIn, Novartis, Nationwide, SAP and UBM.</p>
                        <p>This success didn't come easy. Shipping a large quantity of mobile apps creates interesting technical problems to solve. There's the operational challenge of packaging that volume of apps effectively. There’s the spiky nature of our traffic when tens of thousands of people simultaneously try to log in and slam the API. (Plus we serve millions of customers a year.) There’s our data pipeline that processes billions of data points. We capture taps, swipes, and scrolls and report on them in real time.</p>
                        <p>And then there’s the fact that we’re coming on those startup awkward teen years where a monolithic codebase won’t scale much further. We’re moving off our .NET stack to more modern technologies, and we’re getting our data, automation, and deployment pipelines in order. Some of our new technologies and tools include: Java, Node.js, Go, Kafka, AngularJS, Postgres, Docker, Microservices, Event-Sourcing, and CQRS.</p>

They hired me to help growing their business and guide them through a period of rapid growth, from a handful of customers, to thousands of active customers in just a few months. I also was an important counterpartner for the CTO to help solving deep technical challenges and helped the CEO to accelerate growth. I still think a lot about this time and look back with pride. They got <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/wercker/index.html">acquired by Oracle</a> in 2017.</p>
