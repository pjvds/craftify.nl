# Craftify.nl

This ~~is~~ will become my personal handcrafted website.

## Learning goals

I wouldn't handcraft a website if it wasn't for fun and practise. My current
learning themes are:

* Html5
* Responsive Design
* Javascript
* Hyde

## Build

Execute the `build.sh` script to build the site. The result can be found in the `deploy`
folder.

## Local hosting

Execute the `host.sh` script to host the site with cherrypy on `localhost:8080`.
